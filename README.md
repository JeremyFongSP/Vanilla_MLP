# Vanilla MLP

Multilayer Perceptrons made from scratch to recognize written digits in a 20x20 pixel grid picture. The OCT files are data taken from Andrew NG's Coursera Course used in Octave.

## Python
Started off by testing the simplest cases where the MLP would simply try to figure out a predetermined function, eg: y = 3x^2 + 3x - 4 to see if it would work. Then went on to the hand-written digits. Finally, it was applied to my own sleep data that was collected over 9 months. Only the first two experiments were successful. Code has not been cleaned ever since I stopped working on it.

## Julia
Julia code was heavily inspired by code from a github user which I unfortunately cannot find anymore. This was simply done to teach myself the basics of Julia and test out its speed.
