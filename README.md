# Vanilla MLP

Multilayer Perceptrons made from scratch to recognize written digits in a 20x20 pixel grid picture. The OCT files are data taken from Andrew NG's Coursera Course used in Octave.

Julia code was heavily inspired by code from a github user which I unfortunately cannot find anymore. This was done to teach myself Julia.
