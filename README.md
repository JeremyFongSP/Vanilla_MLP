# Vanilla MLP

Multilayer Perceptrons made from scratch to recognize written digits in a 20x20 pixel grid picture. The OCT files are data taken from Andrew NG's Coursera Course used in Octave.

Python code started out with toy cases where I would try and train an MLP to figure out a predetermined function like y = 3x^2 + 3x - 4 to see if it would work. Then went on to the hand-written digits. Finally, it was applied to my own sleep data I collected over close to 9 months. Only the first two experiments were successful. Code has not been cleaned up since I stopped working on it.

Julia code was heavily inspired by code from a github user which I unfortunately cannot find anymore. This was done to teach myself Julia.
